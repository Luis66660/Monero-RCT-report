-N of N, (N-1) of N
-multisignature does not change the transaction schemes
-essentially collaborative transaction signing on transaction outputs stealth-addressed to an aggregated key

-naive aggregation threshold heuristic: basic sum of keys
    -drawbacks: an observer could easily recognize an aggregated public key as sum of other public keys, a sub-threshold signer could cancel other signers' key components
    -modifications: indistinguishable key aggregation

-LSTAG: basic demonstration
-MLSTAG for Monero: walk through signature creation colloquially
-Communication rounds: consolidate multisig cooperation into three steps describing encoding etc:
    1. Build multisig public address (merge)
    2. Seed signatures: key image components, alpha components, and entropy components r
    3. Close signatures: final entropy components for r = alpha - rk*
    
-encoding and decoding messages with shared secrets, necessary for communication between coalition members

-aggregate key and directed acyclic graph for generalized access structures to signing rights
