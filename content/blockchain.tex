-proof of work: merkle trees, nonce, blockhash, hash algorithm
    -difficulty https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/7975/how-does-the-difficulty-adjustment-for-monero-work
    https://cryptonote.org/cns/cns010.txt
    -PoW hash algorithm originally cryptonight https://cryptonote.org/cns/cns008.txt
    updated https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/3253/files
    -merkle tree https://cryptonote.org/cns/cns003.txt [note: can prunable section be replaced with its hash? function calculate_transaction_hash answer is yes. Transaction hash is basically the message signed by MLSAGs except instead of H(range proofs) it is H(prunable) ie H(range proof signatures, MLSAG signatures)]
    
-structure of blockchain
https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/3958/what-is-the-format-of-a-block-in-the-monero-blockchain/6461#6461
    -appendix C.1, block header and miner transaction, appendix C.2 genesis block

-mining
    -consensus mechanism (largest cumulative difficulty)
        -for chain splits, each fork continues until one branch has higher cumulative difficulty
    -block rewards (emission) and penalty function https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/512kwh/useful_for_learning_about_monero_coin_emission/d78tpgi/
        -'base transaction' https://cryptonote.org/cns/cns003.txt
    -fees -> summed into block reward and published in the miner tx(create_miner_tx function)
    -mempool https://cryptonote.org/cns/cns009.txt

-discussion of ring size/verification times
